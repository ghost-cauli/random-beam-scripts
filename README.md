random beamng scripts I used for uhhhhh

## zip-merger

This PowerShell script groups and merges files under specified size (in MB) while maintaining original file structures and creating backups. It was made to generate packs of mods for BeamMP, so that you have 5 large zips to download instead of 758 small ones.

Example use case: put it in your /mods/repo/ folder to merge small mods into bigger packs.
